# px4_ysu_dev_infuture
(Will be Published in future)
X-type quadrotor UAV motor distributed control development project (without using "distribution matrix" calculations) YSUQZ opens the project as a template for subsequent program development.
It is not stable now, we aim to develop

The current firmware control effect is not completely guaranteed, this firmware will be released on Github in the future.
1. New uORB TOPICS are included in the firmware, including some new messages output to uORB and output to plotJugger for drawing.
2. Different from the control of the PX4 original firmware, a new control mode is adopted.
3. Integrate some sensor data and Kalman filter data in two arrays, see EXCEL table for details.
